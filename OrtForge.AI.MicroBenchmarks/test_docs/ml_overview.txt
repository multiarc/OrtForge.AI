Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error with rewards

Popular algorithms include:
- Linear regression and logistic regression
- Decision trees and random forests
- Support vector machines
- Neural networks and deep learning
- K-means clustering
- Natural language processing

Applications span across industries including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, and computer vision.
